# Number Chain

Chain up the numbers

## Instructions

* Using a while loop, ask the user "How many numbers?", then print out a chain of ascending numbers, starting at 0.

* After the results have printed ask the user if they would like to continue.

  * If "y", restart the process, starting at 0 again.

  * If "n", exit the chain.

## Bonus

* Rather than just displaying numbers constantly starting at 0, have the numbers begin at the end of the previous chain.


number = input("How Many Numbers? ")
# Loop while a condition is being met
nummber = "How many numbers"

while run == "How many numbers":
    print("Hi!")
    run = input("To run again. Enter 'y': ")
# Collects the user's input for the prompt "How Many NUmbers?"
number = input("How Many Numbers? ")
