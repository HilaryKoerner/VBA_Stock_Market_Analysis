# VBA Homework

For this assignment, I analyzed stock market data that spanned three years (2014-2016). To complete this assignment, I created a script that could loop through one small subset of data and then tested the script on the three years. 

1. I looped through the stock data and created the ticker symbol for each stock
2. I found the yearly change and percent change for the opening and closing amounts of each stock. For the yearli change I applied a conditional color format for positive and negative values. 
3. I calculated the total sum of the stock volume for each ticker.
