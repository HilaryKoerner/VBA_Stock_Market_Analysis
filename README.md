# VBA Stockmarket Analysis

Using VBA, I analyzed stock market data that spanned three years (2014-2016). To complete this assignment, I created a script that could loop through a small subset of data and then tested the script on the three years.

1. I looped through the stock data and created the ticker symbol for each stock
2. I found the yearly change and percent change for the opening and closing amounts of each stock. For the yearli change I applied a conditional color format for positive and negative values. 
3. I calculated the total sum of the stock volume for each ticker.

While testing, I found it cumbersome to clear out the data each time I ran it and in between edits to my code, so I created a button to reset the data. I also created a button to run the analysis.
